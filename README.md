### Extra Credit 1:
## LMS Home Page

All content for the top half of the page loaded from a JS object (classData.js).

All CSS for the top half of the page rebuilt as SASS using modules and compiled to a minified CSS production file with Gulp.

### Further Improvement

# move the structure to a Vuejs setup for better DOM handling.
# contrinue refactoring of SASS files
# move data from object to database
